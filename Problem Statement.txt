I need a 'simple' python app to be developed to gather rss/atom feeds and store in a db

preferred modules
- feed parser

Input:
table (SQL) with rss url feeds

output
new rss messages (vs previous run) written to database (SQL)
table meta : per news item: load date , source, message, + json object with all the retrieved data
(sql db can be sqlite, however later can be a amazon rds postgres instance)
log table to indicate
- run through
- RSS feed issues
- rss not responding/...
- parsing issues

errors should be max handled and clean connection open & close

the goal is to run this script every 5-10 min on a was micro instance & needs to run through 1000 RSS feeds easily
scheduling CRON first then Airflow
